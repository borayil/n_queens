# n_queens
N-Queens problem with Simulated Annealing, Hill Climbing and Genetic algorithm in Python.
The more general version of the 8-Queens Puzzle (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle), 
the N-Queens problem is the problem of placing n queens on a nxn chess board such that none of the queens attack each other. 
There are no possible solutions for 2 and 3 queens because no matter where they are placed, they will be attacking each other.

In this implementation, the problem is solved using multiple algorithms, with very good results from simulated annealing.
